    And shape <- sphere()
    And i <- intersection(1,shape)

    And comps.inside = true
      # normal would have been (0,0,1) but is inverted!

Scenario: Shading an intersection
  Given w <- default_world()
    And r <- ray(point(0,0,-5),vector(0,0,1))
    And shape <- the first object in w
    And i <- intersection(4,shape)
  When comps <- prepare_computations(i,r)
    And c <- shade_hit(w,comps)
  Then c = color(0.38066,0.47583,0.2855)

Scenario: Shading an intersection from the inside
  Given w <- default_world()
    And w.light <- point_light(point(0,0.25,0),color(1,1,1))
    And r <- ray(point(0,0,0),vector(0,0,1))
    And shape <- the second object in w
    And i <- intersection(0.5,shape)
  When comps <- prepare_computations(i,r)
    And c <- shade_hit(w,comps)
  Then c = color(0,90498,0.90498,0.90498)

Scenario: The color when a ray misses
  Given w <- default_world()
    And r <- ray(point(0,0,-5),vector(0,1,0))
  When c <- color_at(w,r)
  Then c = color(0,0,0)

Scenario: The color when a ray hits
  Given w <- default_world()
    And r <- ray(point(0,0,-5),vector(0,0,1))
  When c <- color_at(w,r)
  Then c = color(0.38066,0.47583,0.2855)

Scenario: The color with an intersection behind the ray
  Given w <- default_world()
    And outer <- the first object in w
    And outer.material.ambient <- 1
    And inner <- the second object in w
    And inner.material.ambient <- 1
    And r <- ray(point(0,0,0.75),vector(0,0,-1))
  When c <- color_at(w,r)
  Then c = inner.material.color
